The primary data store for Tripal is Chado.  Chado is an open-source database schema managed by GMOD_.  Chado was selected for Tripal because it is open-source, it is maintained by the community in which anyone can provide input, and use of Chado encourages common data storage between online biological sites which decreases duplication of effort. Chado is meant to be installed into a PostgreSQL database and is designed to house a variety of biological data.  A good understanding of Chado is needed to take full advantage of Tripal.  For example, Tripal comes with a variety of content types. However, if you want to create new content types you must know how that data will be stored in Chado.  Additionally, use of the Bulk Loader (a tab-delimited data loader for custom data formats) requires a good understanding of Chado.  Finally, creating extensions to Tripal requires an understanding of Chado to write SQL and or new Tripal fields.  The following links provide training for Chado.
