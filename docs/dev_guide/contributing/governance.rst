Tripal Governance
==================

Changes to this Document
--------------------------


These guidelines are binding to the Tripal Community. If you have comments or questions, please `comment on the Github issue <https://github.com/tripal/tripal/issues/344>`_. Changes to this document will be made after adequate discussion has occurred and the project management committee has voted in favor of the change.

Governance Structure
---------------------

The Tripal project recognizes these roles:

- Users: They have downloaded Tripal!  Maybe they even have a site!
- Contributors: contributing!  Code, comments, discussion, questions, bug reports.
- Committers: write access to the repository.
- PMC: Makes **code relevant** decisions.
- Oversight committee: Makes **policy level** decisions.  This may overlap with PMC, but the idea is the oversight committee includes parties who are **not necessarily coders** and therefore not reviewing Pull requests etc.
