Third-party Integration
=======================

The following modules provide integration with external third-party tools. For example, they may allow you to easily embed the tool in Drupal/Tripal pages and/or expose data from the tool on your Tripal site.

------------

This module provides a basic interface to allow your users to utilize your server's NCBI BLAST+. There is a simple interface allowing users to paste or upload a query sequence and then select from available databases and a tabular results listing with alignment information and multiple download formats (HTML, TSV, GFF3, XML) available.
