Data Loading/Collection
=======================

The following modules provide interfaces for collection and/or loading of biological data.

Mainlab Chado Loader
---------------------

MCL (Mainlab Chado Loader) is a module that enables users to upload their biological data to chado database schema. Users are required to transfer their biological data into various types of data template files. MCL, then, uploads these data template files into a chado schema.

Tripal Plant PopGen Submission
-------------------------------

The Tripal Plant PopGen Submit (TPPS) Module supports a flexible submission interface for genotype, phenotype, environmental, and metadata for population, association, or landscape genetics studies. The portal walks the user through specific questions and collects georeferenced coordinates on plant accessions and also supports ontology standards, including the Minimal Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment (MIAPPE) (http://www.miappe.org/) and standard genotyping file formats, such as VCF.
